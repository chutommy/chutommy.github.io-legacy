# a summary
summary: "
I'm a passionate self-taught software engineer. I built mainly back-end services
using [Go](https://golang.org/). My projects help businesses to meet their clients' requirements.
My services solve both general and specific business problems. I'm a big fan of
[Open Source](https://github.com/chutommy) projects that I'm very happy to contribute to, especially if
I use them on a daily basis.

***

**I'm in the habit of writing quality and reliable code:**

* I build **scalable** and **easy to maintain** services through **clean** and **carefully crafted** code


* I deliver **fast** and **reliable** software using **modern** technologies and approaches

* I follow **best** practices and principles to achieve **rock-solid** codebases
