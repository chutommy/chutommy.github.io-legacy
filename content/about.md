## ... a backend developer specializing in microservice architecture

---

I build scalable and easy to maintain web services
through clean and carefully crafted code.

One of my main goals is to deliver fast and reliable softwares
using the modern technologies and approaches. I am following
the developer's best practices and principles to achieve
the stable rock solid codebase.

---

### Development Skills

As a self-taught developer, I gained almost all the knowledge
and experience from open source contributions, online courses
like Harvard's CS50 or from my very own personal projects,
which I had came up with, designed and implemented all by myself.

The computer science is a very lively area, which offers
a lot of space for improvement and therefore, just like
any other software engineers, I try to learn new technologies
all the time.

#### Summary (tl;dr)

* SQL (Postgres, MySQL)
* NoSQL (MongoDB)
* Go
* Javascript
* HTML
* CSS (+Bootstrap)
* Bash
* Vimscript
* RPi, Windows, Linux (Fedora, Debian, Ubuntu)
* Vim (NeoVim)
* Bash term
* Git (+GitHub)
* Docker (engine, compose)
* Google Chrome
* curl (REST APIs), grpcurl (gRPC)

#### Back-end

For the backend web development, which is my main specialization,
I prefer to code in my favorite server-side language **Go**, which I am very
comfortable and confident with. For the data manipulation
I usually use **Postgres** or **MySQL** and occasionally
**MongoDB**.

I am very familiar with the server administration,
networking, containerization, deployment, building an API,
database management, unit testing or designing a web
service's architecture.

#### Front-end

I have done a few projects, which required frontend,
so I am acquainted with the basics of **HTML** and **CSS**
with **Bootstrap**. I have a little less experience
with the **Javascript**, which I am not very productive with
but I have always managed to satisfy the requirements
and solve the problem that I was initially introduced with.

#### Other programming languages

There are other programming languages, that are not
directly needed in web development, but it is good
to know them. For example, I use **Bash**
for the installation (*install.sh*) or automatic
testing (*test.sh*) of my codebase.

I am also using the **Vimscript** for custom scripts
of an IDE of my choice, which is Vim.

#### Systems

As for the operating system, I had been using **Windows**
for really long time and therefore I have a lot
of experience with this OS. On the other hand, I have
been coding and developing on the **Linux** machines
only. I have been switching and trying to find the best
Linux distribution for me for the past few years.
I am using **Fedora** now, but I am well acquanted with
the **Debian** and **Ubundu**, too. I also work with **Raspbian
OS** that runs on Raspberry Pi computers which I use
for my IoT hobby.

#### Development tools

The IDE of my choice is definitely **Vim**, respectively
**NeoVim**, with a combination of **Bash terminal**.
For the version control, I use naturally **Git** (and
**GitHub**). I containerized my applications with the
most popular containerization tool
**Docker** (*engine* and *compose*). For the frontend,
I chose to use Google Chrome, which is an industry
standart for the web development. The REST APIs and
gRPC services I am testing with the **curl** and
**grpcurl** commands, which are very simple but
powerful.
