## ... a backend developer specializing in microservice architecture

---

I build scalably and easy to maintain web services
through clean and carefully crafted code.

One of my main goals is to deliver fast and reliable softwares
using the modern technologies and approaches. I am following
the developer's best practices and principles to achieve
the stable rock solid codebase.

### Development Skills and Tools

![Development tools](/img/about/dev-tools.png)

As a self-taught developer, I gained almost all the knowledge
and experience from open-source contributions, online courses
like Harvard's CS50 or from my very own personal projects.

The computer science is a very lively area, which offers
a lot of space for improvement and therefore, just like
any other software engineers, I try to learn new technologies
all the time.

#### Summary (TL;DR)

**Programming languages:**

| Backend | Frontend | Other |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Go | Javascript | Bash |
| Postgres | HTML | Markdown |
| MySQL | CSS + Bootstrap | Vimscript |
| MongoDB |

**Development tools:**

| Systems | Dev Tools |
| :--- | :--- |
| Fedora | Vim (NeoVim) |
| Debian | Bash terminal |
| Raspbian | Git (+ GitHub)
| Ubuntu | Docker (engine, compose)
| Windows | Google Chrome |
| | curl (for REST APIs)
| | grpcurl (for gRPC)

#### Back-end

![Frontend](/img/about/development.png)

For the backend web development, which is my main specialization,
I prefer to code in my favorite server-side language **Go**, which I am very
comfortable and confident with. For the data manipulation,
I usually use **Postgres** or **MySQL** and occasionally
**MongoDB**.

I am very familiar with the **server administration**,
**networking**, **containerization**, **deployment process**, **building an API**,
**database management**, **unit testing** or **designing a web
service's architecture**.

#### Front-end

I have done a few projects, which required frontend,
so I am acquainted with the **HTML** and **CSS**
with **Bootstrap**. I have also a little experience
with the **Javascript**, which I am not very productive with,
but I have always managed to satisfy the requirements
and solve the problem that I was initially introduced with.

#### Other programming languages

There are other programming languages, that are not
directly needed in web development, but it is good
to know them. For example, I use **Bash**
for the installation (*install.sh*) and automatic
testing (*test.sh*) of my code or **Markdown** language
for its documentation. I am also using the **Vimscript**
for custom scripts in my IDE - Vim.

#### Systems

As for the operating system, I had been using **Windows**
for really long time and therefore, I have a lot
of experience with this OS. On the other hand, I have
been coding and developing on the **Linux** machines
only. I have been switching and trying to find the best
Linux distribution that suits me for the past few years.
I am using **Fedora** now, but I am well acquainted with
the **Debian** and **Ubundu**, too. I also know **Raspbian
OS** quite well because it is one of few OS that actually
runs on Raspberry Pi computers, which I use for my IoT hobby,
without any major issues.

#### Development tools

The IDE of my choice is definitely **Vim**, respectively
**NeoVim**, with a combination of **Bash terminal**.
For the version control, I use of course **Git** (and
**GitHub**). I containerized my applications with the
most popular containerization tool
**Docker** (*engine* and *compose*). For the frontend,
I chose to use Google Chrome, which is an industry
standart for the web development. The **REST APIs** and
**gRPC** services I am testing with the **curl** and
**grpcurl** commands, which are very simple, but yet
extremely powerful.
